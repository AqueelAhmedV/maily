## Inspiration
As the number of subscribers and followers grows, managing email campaigns can become a time-consuming and overwhelming task. An efficient email marketing tool that automates repetitive tasks such as scheduling, managing lists, and personalizing emails can save content creators valuable time and resources. 

## What it does
 The tool provides a user-friendly interface that enables content creators to manage their email lists, schedule email,  bulk-email and design visually appealing emails using the rich text/wysiwyg editor.

## What's next for Maily 
Scaling it for a large user-base, implementing authentication,
Mass-mail scheduling
